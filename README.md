# WinRipEncode
ðŸš§ Under Construction - Very Early Development ðŸš§  
Effortlessly rip your BluRay/DVDs, transcode the content, and automatically rename files with ease.  
Utilizing MakeMKV, HandBrake, and FileBot to (mostly) automate the process of ripping, transcoding, and renaming your BluRays/DVDs on Windows.  

## Current Stage of Development

As mentioned above, this project started just a few days ago and is in a very early development stage. Iâ€™m not a professional developer and am doing this purely for fun in my free time. The code currently has very few checks and might crash easily if something unexpected happens.  
The GUI is not functional at the moment, and the FileBot feature has not been implemented yet!

## Requirements Before Using the Script


Before you start, you will need the following programs:  

-   MakeMKV
-   HandBrakeCLI
-   FileBot
-   Windows Media Player (Legacy) -> Only required if you want to automatically eject the disc after the ripping process.


## How to use the Skript

Instructions will follow soon!
